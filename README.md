# Bayesian inference of stochastic processes using Neural density estimation

Currently has implementation of a coupling based flow (like a real-NVP) for direct posterior estimation. Still to add more improvements.

## Dependency

I have used the [FLAX](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) package for [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) to implement the neural networks. Thus installation of Jax and FLAX is required in addition to the standard scientific Python stack.
